## antiantivirus

This project aims to try to prevent anti-viruses from detecting executables. 100% written in NT command scripts.

### Usage

All you need to do is just run main.cmd with two arguments: the input EXE (must be a single-file EXE) and an output directory. This tool needs two files, so it outputs to a directory. Here is the syntax:

```
main innocent.exe protected
```

### Debugging

It is recommended to use `test.cmd` to debug. Just open it and after a few seconds, if you see a Ninite, just press No.
